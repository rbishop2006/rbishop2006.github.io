        <p>
          After leaving San Jose, CA to move to Las Vegas, NV, my employer
          TechCU offered me the opportunity to pilot a new remote role at the
          Credit Union. TechCU was looking for the right employee candidate to
          test this program due to the discipline required and security concerns
          of working in real time with customer banking details from home. The
          pilot included cooperation with myself, IT, the Executive Team, the
          AVP and VP of the Contact Center in order to make this project a
          success. We were successful in that I was a fully functional Contact
          Center Specialist for a CA Credit Union while living full-time in Las
          Vegas for the entire term of the 12 month trial. Many employees did
          not know I was remote and none of our customers knew. The Executive
          Team was able to approve the program with our Board of Directors and
          implement the remote model across several departments in 2019 making
          this remote agent pilot program a success. My specific
          responsibilities included all banking verification and full account
          services for our customers.

          My responsibilities at TruLocal have been primarily dedicated to the
          Search route of the website. I was hired to create a dynamic front end
          user experience utilizing Material-UI react components and a search
          engine interface powered by Algolia. My team was supplied Figma
          designs and kept version control using Atlassian BitBucket while using
          JIRA tickets and Confluence resource pages to collaborate. I
          participated in daily stand-ups and weekly sprints with the
          development team. Having been one of the most familiar with Algolia, I
          was frequently asked to educate teammates on the best implementation
          strategy of the search results in their tasks.

          A life long passion of mine is playing music. In 2008, I followed my
          passion of playing drums into a lifestyle by taking a position as an
          onboard musician on cruise ships. Living on ships and playing music
          was a very unique and enjoyable experience in my life, affording me an
          opportunity to travel to many places and meet my wife along the way.

          In addition to facilitating the loan process for customers purchasing
          homes, mortgage loan officer develops accounts with lead sources such
          as Credit Unions and Realtors. My time was split between business
          development and customer application duties while working at Member
          Mortgage Solutions. I left the job due to the 2008 mortgage crisis,
          there were no home loans available and no customers purchasing at that
          time.
