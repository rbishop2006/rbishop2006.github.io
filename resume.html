              The keys to my success have been communication and time management
              skills along with a drive to learn new technologies. I am
              experienced with working on deadlines, collaborating with team
              members, and target goals that need to be achieved. I have learned
              new technologies at the request of my supervisors and I am
              dedicated to developing great looking websites that function
              efficiently and intuitively.

          HealCo is focused on bringing medical providers to communities that
          need them the most. HealCo has been helping providers expand their
          practices and share their underutilized medical space for two years.
          In 2020, they launched the Health System Without Walls initiative,
          which is enabling and facilitating telemedicine throughout the Jersey
          City, NJ area. Recently, HealCoRx was launched, which is a low-cost,
          remote physician, prescription fulfillment and delivery service that
          offers several direct to consumer medication options as well as talk
          therapy introductions that provide mental health services.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Full Stack Engineer, I worked with a lightweight engineering team
          that relied on stellar communication, collaboration and
          time-management. We followed a task-based milestone system and
          expected everyone to contribute their best work with integrity and
          passion. Since we worked closely together, it was important to be a
          team player and learn from others. At the same time, everyone was
          allowed a great degree of independence, so being self-motivated was a
          must.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our entire application is written in TypeScript on the front end and
          back end. I was asked to learn TypeScript as a requisite to employment
          as it was a product design requirement and I have enjoyed doing so.
          Additionally, I was asked to research and begin to implement a testing
          framework using JEST and React Testing Library in our application
          without direction or supervision. This was a greatly satisfying
          activity as I enjoy learning new technologies and seeing those
          contributions assist the team and improve the overall application
          quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team kept version control using GitHub and Notion for
          documentation and a Kanban board for assignments. Weekly technical
          showcases along with department meetings kept everyone on the same
          page for our milestones and status of development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good communication, collaboration and time management were critical
          aspects of my success. I believe my willingness to learn new
          technologies, a drive to solve problems and remaining highly motivated
          made me a valuable member of the team.

          TruLocal is an e-commerce marketplace focused on local retailers. The
          mission of the site is to provide an efficient bridge between
          consumers and their local retailers across all product categories.
          Consumers can see what's in a store and buy online directly through
          TruLocal, and Retailers reach more local consumers through TruLocal's
          marketplace.

          My responsibilities were primarily on the Search route of the
          application leveraging Algolia and creating a responsive UI based on
          Figma designs. All routes were expected to be fully responsive,
          utilizing Chrome Developer Tools and modern CSS3 FlexBox and Grid
          Layouts, we were able to quickly assemble beautiful layouts on all
          screen sizes. I was in good communication with the design team in
          order to keep the application true to their requirements while
          offering suggestions on functionality options available that could be
          integrated into the components. I worked with others to create a
          dynamic front end user experience utilizing Material-UI React
          components per the design theme requirements and included cypress
          tagging in the elements all while working directly with QA to ensure a
          smooth process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search interface was wired with Algolia. My teammate and I
          researched and implemented Algolia’s SearchContext and Algolia’s React
          connected widgets to provide the desired search results and filtering
          options. Having been one of the most familiar with Algolia, I was
          frequently asked to educate teammates on the best implementation
          strategy of the search results in their tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My team kept version control using Atlassian BitBucket while using
          JIRA tickets and Confluence resource pages to collaborate. I
          participated in daily stand-ups and weekly sprints led by the VP of
          Software Engineering / Project Manager with the development team in an
          Agile environment.

          After leaving San Jose, CA to move to Las Vegas, NV, TechCU offered me
          the opportunity to pilot a new remote role at the Credit Union. TechCU
          was looking for the right employee candidate to test this program due
          to the discipline required and security concerns of working in real
          time with customer banking details from home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pilot included cooperation with myself, IT, the Executive Team,
          the AVP and VP of the Contact Center in order to make this project a
          success. We were successful in that I was a fully functional Remote
          Contact Center Specialist while living full-time in Las Vegas for the
          entire term of the 12 month trial.
