        <p>
          After leaving San Jose, CA to move to Las Vegas, NV, my employer
          TechCU offered me the opportunity to pilot a new remote role at the
          Credit Union. TechCU was looking for the right employee candidate to
          test this program due to the discipline required and security concerns
          of working in real time with customer banking details from home. The
          pilot included cooperation with myself, IT, the Executive Team, the
          AVP and VP of the Contact Center in order to make this project a
          success. We were successful in that I was a fully functional Contact
          Center Specialist for a CA Credit Union while living full-time in Las
          Vegas for the entire term of the 12 month trial. Many employees did
          not know I was remote and none of our customers knew. The Executive
          Team was able to approve the program with our Board of Directors and
          implement the remote model across several departments in 2019 making
          this remote agent pilot program a success. My specific
          responsibilities included all banking verification and full account
          services for our customers.

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          My role in Business Development for TechCU's auto loan channel was to
          improve, expand and maintain our working relationships with the
          franchise auto dealers in the San Jose Region. I made regular in
          person dealer account calls in order to promote TechCU products as
          well as resolve in process loan application issues for our customers.
          To ensure a smooth process for our customers, I collaborated with
          dealer contacts, TechCU's banking staff, and the Underwriting
          Department.

          Sr Relationship Banker responsibilities included all in branch
          customer account services as well as currency inventory management.
          Staff was expected to keep audit logs and maintain dual control on
          currency movements in the vault. In addition to account services,
          Branch staff exercised discretion on customer accounts and strict
          compliance with all banking regulations. Our Branch was run by a small
          team and cooperation was key to our success.

          A life long passion of mine is playing music. In 2008, I followed my
          passion of playing drums into a lifestyle by taking a position as an
          onboard musician on cruise ships. Living on ships and playing music
          was a very unique and enjoyable experience in my life, affording me an
          opportunity to travel to many places and meet my wife along the way.

          In addition to facilitating the loan process for customers purchasing
          homes, mortgage loan officer develops accounts with lead sources such
          as Credit Unions and Realtors. My time was split between business
          development and customer application duties while working at Member
          Mortgage Solutions. I left the job due to the 2008 mortgage crisis,
          there were no home loans available and no customers purchasing at that
          time.
